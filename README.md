# TeensyCam-SW
Arduino (teensyduino) project to create firmware for TeensyCam - stereo camera module

* Only able to utilize full-speed USB port of Teensy 3.6, as the high-speed USB device mode driver was not available (as of end 2018, => https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/46466-Teensy-3-6-USB-High-Speed-status?#post187104).
* Otherwise, camera works well.
